A software implementation of the Floating Point Adder. 

### Input
- A text file with each line containing a pair of floating point numbers to be added, in binary
representation (a string of ‘0’ and ‘1’ characters in the file).

### Output
- A sequence of addition results, each line containing one result (a string of ‘0’ and ‘1’
characters) and the number of clock cycles required for performing the addition.
